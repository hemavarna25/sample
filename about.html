        <h1>About Food Waste Management</h1>
        <p>Food waste management is the process of reducing, recovering, and recycling food waste to minimize its environmental impact. It involves various strategies such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Source reduction: Encouraging consumers and businesses to reduce food waste at the source by buying only what they need and using leftovers effectively.</li>
            <li>Donation: Redistributing surplus food to those in need through food banks, shelters, and charitable organizations.</li>
            <li>Composting: Recycling food scraps and organic waste to produce nutrient-rich compost for soil enrichment.</li>
            <li>Energy recovery: Converting food waste into biogas or biofuel through anaerobic digestion or other technologies for renewable energy production.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Efficient food waste management helps conserve resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate hunger, and promote sustainability.</p>
